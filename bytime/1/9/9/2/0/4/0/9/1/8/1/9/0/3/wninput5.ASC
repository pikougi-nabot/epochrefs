NAME
     noun._s_u_f_f_i_x, verb._s_u_f_f_i_x, adj._s_u_f_f_i_x  -  WordNet  lexicogra-
     phers' files which are input to grind(1)

DESCRIPTION
     Input files correspond to the three parts of  speech  imple-
     mented  in  WordNet  - _n_o_u_n, _v_e_r_b and _a_d_j_e_c_t_i_v_e.  Each input
     file contains a list of synonym sets (_s_y_n_s_e_t_s) for one  part
     of  speech.   The information in a synset contains a list of
     synonymous words or collocations, semantic pointers to other
     synsets,  and possibly a textual gloss.  For different parts
     of speech, this basic information is augmented as  necessary
     to fully describe the relations between the synsets.

     See wngloss(7) for a glossary of WordNet terminology  and  a
     discussion  of  the database's content and logical organiza-
     tion.

     Input _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e_s are of the form:

          _p_a_t_h_n_a_m_e/_p_a_r_t._s_u_f_f_i_x

     where _p_a_t_h_n_a_m_e is optional and _p_a_r_t is either noun, verb  or
     adj.   _s_u_f_f_i_x may be used to separate groups of synsets into
     different files, for example noun.animal and noun.plant.

     (The remainder of this discussion uses _w_o_r_d in place of _w_o_r_d
     _o_r _c_o_l_l_o_c_a_t_i_o_n.)


  Pointers
     Semantic  pointers  are  used  to  represent  the  relations
     between  the words in a synset and other synsets.  A pointer
     to another synset is formed by a word from the  synset  fol-
     lowed  by a pointer symbol which indicates the pointer type,
     and therefore the relation.  Although there are many pointer
     types,  each  part  of  speech  only allows certain types of
     relations between synsets.

     The pointer symbols for nouns are:

          !    Antonym
          @    Hypernym
          9~8    Hyponym
          #m   Member meronym
          #s   Substance meronym
          #p   Part meronym
          %m   Member holonym
          %s   Substance holonym
          %p   Part holonym

     The pointer symbols for verbs are:

          !    Antonym
          @    Hypernym
          9~8    Hyponym
          *    Entailment

          \    Pertainym (pertains to noun)
          ^    See also


     Many pointer types are reflexive, meaning that if  a  synset
     contains  a  pointer  to  another  synset,  the other synset
     should contain the corresponding reflexive pointer.  A truly
     complete  input  file  explicitly  contains all pointers and
     their reflexives.  grind(1)  automatically  inserts  missing
     reflexive pointers for the pointers below:

          Pointer             Reflect
          Antonym        Antonym

  Verb Frames
     A verb synset contains a _v_e_r_b _f_r_a_m_e _l_i_s_t  which  illustrates
     which  types of simple sentences the verbs in the synset can
     be used in.  The verb sentence frames are entered in a  syn-
     set  as  a  comma separated list of integers.  The following
     sentence templates are the text of the verb frames:

     1   Something____s
     2   Somebody____s
     3   it is____ing
     4   Something is_____ing PP

Synset Syntax
     Synsets are entered one per line, with a  newline  (carriage
     return)  at the end.  The text of a synset may be as long as
     necessary, but no newlines can be entered within  a  synset.
     Within  a  synset,  spaces  or  tabs may be used to separate
     entities.

     The general synset syntax is:

          {  words  pointers  definition  }

     Synsets of this form are valid for all parts of  speech  are
     are  referred  to  as  _b_a_s_i_c  _s_y_n_s_e_t_s.  At least one word is
     required to form  a  valid  synset.   The  other  constructs
     within a synset are optional.  For verbs, the following syn-
     tax is also accepted:

          {  words  pointers  frames  definition  }

     Adjective synsets are  organized  into  adjective  _c_l_u_s_t_e_r_s,
     which  contain  one  or more _h_e_a_d _s_y_n_s_e_t_s and _s_a_t_e_l_l_i_t_e _s_y_n_-
     _s_e_t_s. Adjective clusters are of the form:

          [
          _h_e_a_d _s_y_n_s_e_t
          _o_p_t_i_o_n_a_l _s_a_t_e_l_l_i_t_e _s_y_n_s_e_t_s

          ]

     Each adjective cluster is enclosed in square  brackets,  and
     may  have  one or more parts.  Parts are separated by one or
     more hyphens on a line by themselves, with  the  terminating
     square bracket following the synsets of the last part.  Head
     and satellite synsets look syntactically like basic synsets,
     however a "similar" pointer must be specified in a head syn-
     set to each of its satellite synsets.

     Synsets for adjective pertainyms do not adhere to the  clus-
     ter structure.  Pertainyms use the basic synset syntax.

     See wngloss(7) for a thorough description of adjective clus-
     ters,  and  Special Adjective Syntax for more information on
     adjective cluster syntax.

     Comments can be entered by enclosing the text of the comment
     in  parentheses.   Note that comments cannot appear within a
     synset, as parentheses within a synset have an entirely dif-
     ferent meaning (see Textual Gloss Syntax ).  However, entire
     synsets (or adjective clusters) can be  "commented  out"  by
     enclosing them in parentheses.  This is useful for verifying
     the syntax of files under development.


  Word Syntax
     A synset must have at least one word, and  the  words  of  a
     synset  must  appear  after the opening brace and before any
     other synset constructs.  A word may be  entered  in  either
     the _s_i_m_p_l_e _w_o_r_d or _w_o_r_d/_p_o_i_n_t_e_r syntax.

     A simple word is of the form:

          _w_o_r_d,

     _w_o_r_d may be entered in either upper or lower case, or a com-
     bination,  unless it is in an adjective cluster (see Special
     Adjective Syntax ).  A collocation is entered by joining the
     individual  words  with  an  underscore  character.  Numbers
     (integer or real) may be entered, either by themselves or as
     part of a word string, by following the number with a double
     quote ("). _w_o_r_d may be immediately followed  by  an  integer
     _s_e_n_s_e  _n_u_m_b_e_r.   The  sense  number  is  used to distinguish
     occurrences of the same word in different synsets  within  a
     single file.  Sense numbers must also be used on pointers to
     allow grind(1) to match a pointer to the appropriate synset.

     A word/pointer is of the form:

WNINPUT(5)                   WordNet                   WNINPUT(5)



          [  _w_o_r_d,  _p_o_i_n_t_e_r_s  ]

     This syntax is used when one  or  more  pointers  correspond
     only  to  the  specific word in the word/pointer set, rather
     than all the words in the synset.  Note that a  word/pointer
     set  appears  within a synset, therefore the square brackets
     used to enclose it are different than those used  to  define
     an  ajdective  cluster.   Only  one word can be specified in
     word/pointer set, however any  number  of  pointers  may  be
     included.

     For verbs, the word/pointer syntax is extended in  the  fol-
     lowing  manner  to  allow  the  user  to specify verb frames
     which, like pointers, correspond only to the specific  word,
     rather  than  all  the  words.   In  this case, _p_o_i_n_t_e_r_s are
     optional.

          [  _w_o_r_d,  _p_o_i_n_t_e_r_s  _f_r_a_m_e_s  ]


  Pointer Syntax
     Pointers are optional in synsets.  If a pointer is specified
     outside  of a word/pointer construct, the pointer is applied
     to all of the words  in  the  synset,  including  any  words
     specified  using  the  word/pointer  syntax.   If  specified
     within a word/pointer  construct,  the  pointer  corresponds
     only to the words in the construct.

     If specified, a pointer is of the form:

          _w_o_r_d,_p_o_i_n_t_e_r__s_y_m_b_o_l

     _w_o_r_d is a word in another  synset.   The  synset  containing
     _w_o_r_d  may  reside in another input file.  In this case, _w_o_r_d
     is preceded by the filename, and the pointer has the follow-
     ing form:

          _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e:_w_o_r_d,_p_o_i_n_t_e_r__s_y_m_b_o_l

     _W_o_r_d may be followed by a sense  number  which  is  used  to
     match  the pointer to the correct target synset in the file.
     See Pointers for a list of pointer symbols and  their  mean-
     ings.


  Verb Frame List Syntax
     Verb frames must be entered in each verb synset.  If a  verb
     frame list is specified outside of a word/pointer construct,
     the verb frame list applies to all of the words in the  syn-
     set,  including  any  words specified using the word/pointer
     syntax.  If specified within a word/pointer  construct,  the
     verb  frame  list  corresponds  only  to  the  word  in  the

     construct.

     A verb frame list is entered as a list of verb frame numbers
     as follows:

          frames: _i_n_t_e_g_e_r__l_i_s_t

     Where _i_n_t_e_g_e_r__l_i_s_t is a comma separated  list  of  integers,
     each  one  corresponding  a verb frame simple sentence.  See
     Verb Frames  for  a  list  of  simple  sentences  and  their
     corresponding frame numbers.


  Textual Gloss Syntax
     An optional textual gloss may be included in a synset.   The
     author  may  enter  a  text string of any length desired.  A
     textual gloss is simply a  string  enclosed  in  parentheses
     with  no  embedded  carriage returns, and is usually used to
     provide an explanation for the synset, often to  distinguish
     senses  of  the primary (usually the first) word in the syn-
     set.


  Special Adjective Syntax
     In addition to the concept of adjective clusters,  adjective
     synsets  have several special requirements and options.  The
     first word of a _h_e_a_d _s_y_n_s_e_t must be entered in upper case. A
     pointer  to  another  head synset in the cluster (usually an
     antonym) must also be entered in upper case.

     Adjective clusters are organized such that the head  synsets
     of  a  cluster contain antonyms.  All of the words in a head
     synset which contain direct antonyms elsewhere in the  clus-
     ter  are  entered  in upper case.  Within part of a cluster,
     the satellite synsets are conceptually related to  the  head
     synset,  and  a  "similar to" pointer is used reflexively to
     show this relation (the "similar to"  pointers  are  usually
     entered  in  the head synset only).  A _c_r_o_s_s-_c_l_u_s_t_e_r _p_o_i_n_t_e_r
     may be specified which allows a head or satellite synset  to
     point  to  a  head  synset of a different cluster.  A cross-
     cluster pointer is indicated by entering the  _w_o_r_d  part  of
     the pointer in upper case.

     Adjectives may be annotated with a  _s_y_n_t_a_c_t_i_c  _m_a_r_k_e_r  which
     indicates  a  limitation  on  the  syntactic position of the
     adjective with relation to noun that  it  modifies.   If  so
     marked,  the marker appears between the word and its follow-
     ing comma.  If a sense number is specified, the marker  fol-
     lows the sense number as well.  The syntactic markers are:


          (p)  predicate position
