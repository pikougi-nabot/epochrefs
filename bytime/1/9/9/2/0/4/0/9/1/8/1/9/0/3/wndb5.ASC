DESCRIPTION
     For each part of speech, two files are used to represent the
     WordNet  database  -  index._p_o_s  and  data._p_o_s, where _p_o_s is
     either _n_o_u_n, _v_e_r_b, or _a_d_j.  The  database  is  in  an  ASCII
     representation  which  is human and machine readable, and is
     easily accessible to those who wish to use it with their own
     applications.   The WordNet system provides command line and
     X Windows interfaces to the database.  For PC users, only  a
     command line interface is available.

     See wngloss(7) for a glossary of WordNet terminology  and  a
     discussion  of  the database's content and logical organiza-
     tion.

     Index File Format

     An index file is an alphabetized list of all  of  the  words
     and  collocations  in  WordNet for the corresponding part of
     speech.  Collocations are formed by joining individual words
     with an underscore character. (The remainder of this discus-
     sion uses _w_o_r_d in place of _w_o_r_d _o_r _c_o_l_l_o_c_a_t_i_o_n.)   Words  in
     the  index  file  are  in lower case only, regardless of how
     they were entered in the lexicographers' files.  The WordNet
     search  code uses a binary search to look for a string in an
     index file.

     Each index file begins with several lines containing a copy-
     right  notice,  version number and license agreement.  These
     lines are entered in a form that is not harmful to a  binary
     search,  and  are  terminated  as  described  below for data
     lines.

     Each data line of  an  index  file  contains  the  following
     fields and is _t_e_r_m_i_n_a_t_e_d _w_i_t_h _t_w_o _s_p_a_c_e_s _a_n_d _a_n _e_n_d _o_f _l_i_n_e.
     For Unix, this is a newline (0x0a), and for the PC this is a
     carriage  return,  linefeed  sequence  (0x0d,  0x0a).  Items
     enclosed in square brackets may not be present.  Fields  are
     separated by one space.

          word  pos  poly_cnt  ptr_cnt  [ptr_types]  synset_cnt  synset_offset  [synset_offset...]

     word           ASCII text of word.

     pos            Part of speech: n for noun files, v for  verb
                    files, a for adjective files.

     poly_cnt       Decimal number of different senses (polysemy)
                    _w_o_r_d  has  in  dictionary.  Note that this is
                    not the number of  sense  that  _w_o_r_d  has  in
                    WordNet.

     ptr_cnt        Decimal number of different types of pointers
                    _w_o_r_d has in all synsets which contain _w_o_r_d.

     ptr_types      A space separated list of  _p_t_r__c_n_t  different
                    types  of  pointers that _w_o_r_d has in all syn-
                    sets which contain _w_o_r_d. See wninput(5) for a
                    list  of  pointer  symbols.  If a word has no
                    pointers, this field is omitted  and  _p_t_r__c_n_t
                    is 0.

     synset_cnt     Decimal number  of  synsets  that  this  word
                    appears in.

     synset_offset  A list  of  one  or  more  indices  into  the
                    corresponding  data._p_o_s  file,  one  for each
                    occurrence   of    _w_o_r_d    in    a    synset.
                    synset_offset is an 8 digit, right justified,
                    zero-filled decimal  integer  indicating  the
                    byte  offset of the synset in the correspond-
                    ing data._p_o_s file.


     Data File Format

     A data file contains information corresponding to  the  syn-
     sets  that  were  defined  in the lexicographers' files with
     pointers resolved to actual offsets in data._p_o_s files.

     Each data file begins with several lines containing a  copy-
     right  notice,  version  number and license agreement.  This
     information is followed by a list (one per line) of all  the
     input  files  that  were  included  when grind(1) was run to
     build the database.  These lines are terminated as described
     below for data lines.

     Each data line of a data file contains the following  fields
     and  is  _t_e_r_m_i_n_a_t_e_d _w_i_t_h _t_w_o _s_p_a_c_e_s _a_n_d _a_n _e_n_d _o_f _l_i_n_e.  For
     Unix, this is a newline (0x0a), and for the  PC  this  is  a
     carriage   return/linefeed   sequence  (0x0d,  0x0a).  Items
     enclosed in square brackets may not be present.  Fields  are

     separated  by  one  space.   All integer fields are of fixed
     length and are right justified and zero-filled.

     synset_offset  file_#  pos  word_cnt  word  [word...]  ptr_cnt  [ptr...]  [frame_cnt]  [frame...]  [gloss]


     synset_offset  Current   byte   offset    in    the    file.
                    synset_offset is an 8 digit decimal integer.

     file_#         Two digit decimal  integer  indicating  which
                    file  in  the  list  of filenames this synset
                    comes from.  File numbers begin with 0.

     pos            n for noun synsets, v for verb synset, a  for
                    adjective  cluster head synsets, s for adjec-
                    tive satellite synsets.

     word_cnt       Two digit hexadecimal integer which indicates
                    the number of words in the synset.

     word           ASCII text of a word as it was entered  in  a
                    synset, followed by its WordNet sense number.
                    If a synset contains more than  one  word,  a
                    list of words and sense numbers is generated.
                    For adjective files, a word is followed by  a
                    syntactic  marker if one was specified in the
                    input file.  The syntactic marker is appended
                    onto  the word's text without any intervening
                    spaces.  See wninput(5) for a list of syntac-
                    tic  markers  for  adjectives.  The word (and
                    optional syntactic marker) is followed  by  a
                    space  and  a  one  digit hexadecimal integer
                    which indicates the  sense  number  that  the
                    lexicographer  assigned  to  the word.  If no
                    sense number was assigned, 0  is  used.   The
                    sense  number,  in  conjunction  with _f_i_l_e_#,
                    uniquely identifies each word in WordNet.

     ptr_cnt        Three digit decimal  integer  indicating  the
                    number of pointers from this synset.

     ptr            A list of pointers from the words in the syn-
                    set.   ptr  is a pointer symbol followed by a
                    space, an eight digit decimal  integer  which
                    indicates  the byte offset of the target syn-
                    set, followed by a space and a part of speech
                    character (n, v, a) indicating which data._p_o_s
                    file this pointer indexes into, followed by a
                    space  and  a  four  digit _f_r_o_m/_t_o field. The
                    first two hexadecimal digits of  the  from/to
                    field  indicate which word in the synset that
                    the pointer is from. If the value is  0,  the

                    is  from  all of the words in the synset. The
                    second two hexadecimal digits indicates which
                    word  in the target synset the pointer is to.
                    If 0, the pointer points to all of the  words
                    in  the  target synset.  Synonyms are counted
                    from left to right,  beginning  with  1.  See
                    wninput(5) for a list of pointer symbols.

     frame_cnt      Two digit decimal integer which indicates the
                    number  of  verb  frames in the synset.  This
                    field is present only in verb files.

     frame          For verb files, a list of frame  numbers  for
                    the  words  in  the  synset.   Each  _f_r_a_m_e is
                    represented by a +, followed by a space, fol-
                    lowed  by  a  2  digit  decimal integer which
                    indicates the verb  frame  number.   This  is
                    followed  by  a space and a two digit hexade-
                    cimal integer which indicates which  word  in
                    the  synset  the  verb  frame applies to.  As
                    with pointers, if this number is 0, the frame
                    number  applies  to  all words in the synset.
                    If non-zero, words are counted from  left  to
                    right,  beginning with 1.  See wninput(5) for
                    the text of the verb frames.

     gloss          Each synset may  optionally  have  a  textual
                    gloss.   A gloss is a vertical pipe (|), fol-
                    lowed by a text string.  The _g_l_o_s_s  continues
                    until  the  line  termination is indicated by
                    two spaces and an end of line.
